InnateCoder: Learning Programmatic Options with Foundation Models

This repository contains the code and data for the paper "InnateCoder: Learning Programmatic Options with Foundation Models" by Rubens O. Moraes, Quazi Sadmine, Hendrik Baier, and Levi Lelis.


## Overview
InnateCoder is a system that uses foundation models to give reinforcement learning agents "innate skills" before they start interacting with their environment. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning approaches where agents start from scratch, InnateCoder provides programmatic options (reusable skills) that make learning more efficient.

## How It Works
InnateCoder has three main components:

1. **Learning Options**: Uses a foundation model to generate programmatic policies, which are broken down into smaller "options" (reusable skills).

2. **Semantic Space**: Creates a meaningful space of programs where similar behaviors are grouped together.

3. **Local Search**: Searches through both syntax and semantic spaces to find optimal policies.

## Key Benefits
- More sample-efficient than systems without pre-learned options
- Leverages human knowledge encoded in foundation models
- Generates options in a zero-shot manner (before environment interaction)
- Cost-effective as it only uses the foundation model as a pre-processing step
- Accessible to smaller labs and companies

## Implementation
InnateCoder represents policies as programs written in domain-specific languages (DSLs). Each program receives a state and returns an action for the agent to take. The system was tested in two domains:

- **MicroRTS**: A challenging real-time strategy game
- **Karel the Robot**: A benchmark for program synthesis and reinforcement learning

## Results
Experiments show that InnateCoder is more sample-efficient than versions without options or with options learned from experience. The policies learned are competitive with and often outperform state-of-the-art algorithms.

## Repository Information
The complete implementation is available at: https://github.com/rubensolv/InnateCoder

## Technical Approach
InnateCoder improves on traditional search methods by exploring the "semantic space" of programs rather than just the "syntax space." This means it focuses on program behavior rather than just structure, allowing for more effective search and better results.

# Karel

Karel is a simple programming environment for learning the basics of programming. It provides a set of commands for controlling a robot in a grid world. We used as a benchmark for our system to evaluate the performance of the programmatic options generated by InnateCoder. The main repository used as a base is the Karel repository can be found at: https://github.com/lelis-research/prog_policies.

# MicroRTS

MicroRTS is a research platform for real-time strategy (RTS) games. It is designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of AI algorithms in a competitive gaming environment.
